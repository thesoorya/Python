# modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables. Modules help organize code into reusable units, making it easier to maintain and understand. 

# Built-in Modules:
# Python comes with a standard library that includes a vast collection of modules covering areas such as file I/O, networking, mathematics, data manipulation, and more.
# Examples of built-in modules include math, os, sys, datetime, random, re (regular expressions), json, csv, and many others.
# You can use built-in modules by importing them into your code with the import statement.

# Third-Party Modules:
# Python has a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and modules created by the community to extend its functionality.
# You can install third-party modules using package managers like pip, and then import and use them in your code.

#####################

# Creating Your Own Modules:
# You can create your own modules by writing Python code in separate .py files and then import them into other Python scripts.
# To import a module, you can use either import module_name or from module_name import function_name, class_name.

# importing the module file

import my_module as my_m

my_m.hello()
my_m.bye()
